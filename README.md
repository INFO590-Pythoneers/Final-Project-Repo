# Final-Project-Repo
<h2><strong>INFO-590 Final Project Repository</strong></h2>
<h3>PHASE 1 (30%)</h3>
<p>During the first week, you need to complete following data analysis tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Download the data and load it in Python</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Impute missing values</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Plot basic graphs</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Compute data statistics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">PHASE 1 Contributions:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kathleen DeBrota - Learned how to use github, split dataframe and coded the 9 histograms of A2 to A10, set up scheduled team meetings, cross-checked others' code and ensured it made sense, added insights to the summary analysis, edited for clarity, attended 11/10/18 team web conference and email communications.</li>
<li>Makkari Peter Cheng -Created the initial Jupyter notebook file, created initial imports, download and load data into python, impute the missing values, scatter plots, computer data statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, variance and coefficient of variance and  summary report of what should be standardized due to high variance, attended 11/10/18 team web conference and email communications.</li>
<li>Joshua McGovern - <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">Created the team&rsquo;s GitHub repository, created the folder directory in GitHub, uploaded main data file into GitHub, created/updated GitHub README.md, coded the bar plot for CLASS, merged final version code into GitHub master branch, attended 11/10/18 team web conference, and email communications.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>PHASE 2 (40%)</h3>
<p>In the second phase you will implement k-means algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Revise k-means algorithm</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Write code for &lsquo;Initialization&rsquo; step</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Write code for &lsquo;Assignment&rsquo; step</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Write code for &lsquo;Recalculation&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">PHASE 2 Contributions:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kathleen DeBrota -</li>
<li>Makkari Peter Cheng - Completed revise data variation, plotted standard deviation values with title legends, with y and x axis labels, described features with lots of variation, implement normalization on the data, printed the centroids post normalization, double checked team member's work, submit assignment, attended 11/16/18 team web conference and email communications.</li>
<li>Joshua McGovern - Completed the find optimal number of clusters objective, created the phase 2 GitHub folders for code and data, uploaded the updated .csv data file for phase 2, checked team memberâ€™s work, attended 11/16/18 team web conference and email communications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>PHASE 3 (30%)</h3>
<p>During the third week, you will analyze the quality of the clustering.</p>
<ul>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Write a code to calculate the individual and total error rate of your 2 clusters.</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Report statement (150-200 words)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">PHASE 3 Contributions:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kathleen DeBrota -</li>
<li>Makkari Peter Cheng -</li>
<li>Joshua McGovern -</li>
</ul>
