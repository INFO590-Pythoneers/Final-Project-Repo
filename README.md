# Final-Project-Repo
<h2><strong>INFO-590 Final Project Repository</strong></h2>
<h3>PHASE 1 (30%)</h3>
<p>During the first week, you need to complete following data analysis tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Download the data and load it in Python</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Impute missing values</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Plot basic graphs</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Compute data statistics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">PHASE 1 Contributions:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kathleen DeBrota - Learned how to use github, split dataframe and coded the 9 histograms of A2 to A10, set up scheduled team meetings, cross-checked others' code and ensured it made sense, added insights to the summary analysis, edited for clarity, attended 11/10/18 team web conference and email communications.</li>
<li>Makkari Peter Cheng -Created the initial Jupyter notebook file, created initial imports, download and load data into python, impute the missing values, scatter plots, computer data statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, variance and coefficient of variance and  summary report of what should be standardized due to high variance, attended 11/10/18 team web conference and email communications.</li>
<li>Joshua McGovern - <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">Created the team&rsquo;s GitHub repository, created the folder directory in GitHub, uploaded main data file into GitHub, created/updated GitHub README.md, coded the bar plot for CLASS, merged final version code into GitHub master branch, attended 11/10/18 team web conference, and email communications.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>PHASE 2 (40%)</h3>
<p>In the second phase you will implement k-means algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Revise k-means algorithm</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Write code for &lsquo;Initialization&rsquo; step</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Write code for &lsquo;Assignment&rsquo; step</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Write code for &lsquo;Recalculation&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">PHASE 2 Contributions:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kathleen DeBrota - Sliced the dataframe to remove the Scn and CLASS columns. Implemented KMeans clustering with 4 clusters, explored basic stats of the data, and found/printed the centroid locations per cluster. Double checked teammates' work, attended 11/16/18 meeting. </li>
<li>Makkari Peter Cheng - Completed revise data variation, plotted standard deviation values with title legends, with y and x axis labels, described features with lots of variation, implement normalization on the data, printed the centroids post normalization, double checked team member's work, submit assignment, attended 11/16/18 team web conference and email communications.</li>
<li>Joshua McGovern - Completed the find optimal number of clusters objective, created the phase 2 GitHub folders for code and data, uploaded the updated .csv data file for phase 2, checked team memberâ€™s work, attended 11/16/18 team web conference and email communications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>PHASE 3 (30%)</h3>
<p>During the third week, you will analyze the quality of the clustering.</p>
<ul>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Write a code to calculate the individual and total error rate of your 2 clusters.</li>
<li style="tab-stops: list .5in;">Report statement (150-200 words)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">PHASE 3 Contributions:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kathleen DeBrota - Completed all sections of phase 3 (cluster, dataframe, and error rate function) and compared results with teammates;we all got the same results. Then collaborated on final version to submit. Contributed to and typed the final reflection report. Checked teammates' work, and attended group meeting 12/7/18. </li>
<li>Makkari Peter Cheng - Completed all sections of phase 3 (cluster, dataframe, and error rate function) and compared results with teammates; determined we all got the same results with different implentations between the 3 of us. We did this approach to validate the final error rates we were computing. Collaborated on the final reflection report, submit phase 3 assignment. Assisted teammates with work, attended 12/5/18 team web conference, attended 12/7/18 team web conference and email communications. </li>
<li>Joshua McGovern -The following was completed by each group member and results were compared via web conference (Cluster, DataFrame, and Error Rate Function), collaborated with group in Google Docs on Final Report, attended 12/5/18 team web conference, attended 12/7/18 team web conference and email communications.</li>
</ul>
